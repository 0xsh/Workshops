# Ruxcon-2016
Examples for Ruxcon 2016 SDR workshop

Aim: to build a simple chat server using the audio card, gnu radio companion and python. The purpose is to demonstrate how to use gnuradio-companion, as well as generate and modify the resulting python code.

Step 1
------
Based on tkuester's great PSK31 examples from: https://github.com/tkuester/gr-psk31. Modified slightly to use an audio card instead of a recorded wav file.

Step 2
------
Once working, remove the GUI components which were used for deubugging.

Step 3
-------
Modify the generated python code from gnuradio-companion to make a simple command line chat server.
